# XML Parser (Steeleye Assignment)

- This is an XML Parser code which parses a specific type of XML given in the assignment.

- To run the XML parsing code just run all the cells of the ` main.ipynb ` file. The dataset is stored in an AWS S3 bucket called ` rohitest1 `.

- ` data_cleaning.ipynb ` and ` data_extraction.ipynb ` are the files which were used for testing and understanding the XML structure.

- The link for the hosted dataset can be accessed here [https://rohitest1.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dataset.csv](https://rohitest1.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dataset.csv).

- The S3 bucket code is in the ` s3.ipynb ` file, the access keys and secret keys are hidden for security purposes.

- Thankyou for the oppurtunity, I thoroughly enjoyed and learned new strategies while doing the assignment. The data folder (which contains the XML files) has not been uploaded due to github's file size issues, but have been uploaded in internshala, zipped with the other files.
